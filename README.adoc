Greetings

The current project is a prototype for an urban janitory system. I've already have done a project for 
this business case but code grew a little bit complex and i haven't the guts to touch it again. 
I still aiming to refactor it but i'd rather start a project from scratch.
In this approach i'm trying to provide all required features by writing the less code i can figure out.

=== Stack used:

- Spring boot;
- Spring Security;
- JUnit; ( in attempt to add usefull tests and not deleting them )
- Nuxtjs;
- Android;

=== Project Structure:

- link:api[api] ( relies backend logic );
- link:mobile-ui[mobile-ui] ( self explanatory );
- link:web-ui[web-ui] ( same as the previous item );


There are lots of work to be done
