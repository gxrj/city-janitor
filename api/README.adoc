=== Project Structure

- "core" folder: contains all entity directories. As it follows a domain driven development 
approach, an entity directory groups all layers that related to the respective entity.

- "security" folder: is self explanatory. Handles signing application keys that are stored 
in the database.

- "seed" folder: contains code that initialize some load into the database.

- "utils" folder: self explanatory.

=== Observations

At the moment there is no token rotation strategy and its lifetime is 8 hours long.
It's taken into consideration to remove this concern from resource server and leave 
it to another application like spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server or keycloack.

=== Things to improve:

* [ ] Refactoring
* [ ] Unit Testing
* [ ] Acceptance Testing
* [ ] Integration Testing
* [ ] Token management
